# Long-term backburner project, likely dead.
I don't recall if this version was the working one, but it was (except for a hitch in one part, I can't remember.) School got busy and this project got set aside.
Godot extensions that did the same thing finally updated to 4.2 so this wasn't useful on there. May play around with this again when I go back to Godot, but by then it may be a different version.
Feel free to steal any ideas from this, though they are basic (I think.)

# Plugin Tool for Godot 4.2
A work-in-progress, but attempting to develop my first software for public use.
